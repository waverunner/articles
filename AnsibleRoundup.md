# Ansible Top 10 Round-Up for 2019

Gear up and get crackin' with awesome Ansible automation skills this year!

This year saw a wide range are really helpful Ansible articles. Whether you are just starting out with Ansible or a seasoned pro, there is something for everyone here to learn from.

A good number of these articles are worthy of your bookmarking and perhaps a cron (or maybe a Tower/AWX job) reminder to re-read them periodically.

If you are new to Ansible, the place to start are the following articles: [A quickstart guide to Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/quickstart-guide-ansible) has some good starter information and also dives into more advanced topics.  The articles [10 Ansible modules you need to know](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/must-know-ansible-modules), and [5 ops tasks to do with Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/ops-tasks-ansible) review some of the more fundamental functions that every Ansible admin should be familiar with. [How to use Ansible to document procedures](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/ansible-procedures) also presents a survey of additional topcis that are interesting to follow up on.

The balance of these articles cover more advanced topics like Windows management, testing, hardware, cloud, and containers -- and even a case study in managing the demands of tech-curious children.

I hope you enjoyed this Ansible year as much as I did! Never stop learning ....
