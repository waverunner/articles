# Ansible Top 10 Round-Up for 2019

Gear up and get crackin' with awesome Ansible automation skills this year!

This year saw a wide range are really helpful Ansible articles. Whether you are just starting out with Ansible or a seasoned pro, there is something for everyone here to learn from.

A good number of these articles are worthy of your bookmarking and perhaps a cron (or maybe a Tower/AWX job) reminder to re-read them periodically.

If you are new to Ansible, the place to start are the following articles: [A quickstart guide to Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/quickstart-guide-ansible) has some good starter information and also dives into more advanced topics.  The articles [10 Ansible modules you need to know](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/must-know-ansible-modules), and [5 ops tasks to do with Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/ops-tasks-ansible) review some of the more fundamental functions that every Ansible admin should be familiar with. [How to use Ansible to document procedures](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/ansible-procedures) also presents a survey of additional topcis that are interesting to follow up on.

The balance of these articles cover more advanced topics like Windows management, testing, hardware, cloud, and containers -- and even a case study in managing the demands of tech-curious children.

I hope you enjoyed this Ansible year as much as I did! Never stop learning ....

Did you know Ansible can manage Windows nodes as well? This piece reviews basic Ansible server and Windows client setups with an example on how to deploy an IIS server.


#### 10 Ansible modules you need to know
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/browser_blue_text_editor_web.png?itok=lcf-m6N7)](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/must-know-ansible-modules)
This is a great place to start for some of the most common and basic Ansible modules all admins should know. Running commands, installing packages, and handling files are the basis for many useful automation plays.


#### How to use Ansible to document procedures
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/document_free_access_cut_security.png?itok=ocvCv8G2)](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/ansible-procedures)
Ansible's YAML files make for easy reading, so much so they can be used to document the manual steps needed to accomplish some task. This makes your work easier to debug and extend later on. Contained here are pointers to other related topics like testing and analysis.


#### Using Testinfra with Ansible to verify server state
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/terminal_command_linux_desktop_code.jpg?itok=p5sQ6ODE)](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/using-testinfra-ansible-verify-server-state)
Testing is an integral part of any CI/CD DevOps pipeline ... so why not test Ansible's results as well? This primer on Testinfra can be used to help check the configuration results you need.


#### Hardware bootstrapping with Ansible
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/server_data_system_admin.png?itok=q6HCfNQ8)](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/hardware-bootstrapping-ansible)
Not all the world is containers and virtual machines.  Many of us Sysadmins still have significant hardware deployments to manage.  With a little PXE dust and DHCP magic (among other tid-bits) you can create a convneient framework using Ansible to get real hardware up and running easily.

#### What you need to know about Ansible modules
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/data_container_block.png?itok=S8MbXEYw)](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/developing-ansible-modules)
Modules bring real power to Ansible. Many modules are alerady available -- but when there is none, you may need to roll your own. Read this article to look a bit deeper into how modules are made.

#### 5 ops tasks to do with Ansible
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/innovation_lightbulb_gears_devops_ansible.png?itok=TSbmp3_M)](https://opensource.com/article/19/8/ops-tasks-ansible)
This is another more basic review of Ansible use to manage  common system operations tasks. The spin here are examples given in Tower (or AWX) instead of the old familiar command line.

#### A quickstart guide to Ansible
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/a_quickstart_guide_to_ansible.png?itok=A7aN_W6k)](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/quickstart-guide-ansible)
The quickstart guide is a great PDF download you should keep on hand and re-read over time. It begins with a great primer to get started in Ansible. It also covers other areas of interest including Molecule testing, Sysadmin tasks, and Kubernetes object management to name a few.

#### An Ansible reference guide, CI/CD with Ansible Tower and GitHub, and more news
[![](https://opensource.com/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-wide/public/lead-images/computer_code_programming_laptop.jpg?itok=ormv35tV)](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/ansible-news-edition-one)
A monthly round-up article here full of interesting links to follow. Topics span Ansible basics, managing Netapp E-Series storage, debugging, patching, and more.  Videos are inclulded here as well as some pointers to Ansible meetup groups. Check it out!
