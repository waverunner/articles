# Ansible roundup for 2020

## A great year for fresh Ansible material

Here we are again at the end of another year with a great set of Ansible articles to review.

Looking at the list of submissions, I thought it would be nice to cover these in a series
of progressively advancing topics.  My hope here is to help stimulate the interest of
those just getting started with Ansible. Throughout the year, there were a number of
summary articles posted as well which I've included for your casual follow-up.

I felt that the first 5 articles in this year's list were a really good place for
Ansible neophytes to start out at:

* [7 things you can do with Ansible right now](https://opensource.com/article/20/9/ansible) - If you don’t know much about Ansible, here is a great place to start. This is a nice primer gathering links for managing hardware, cloud, containers, and more!

* [What's the difference between orchestration and automation?](https://opensource.com/article/20/11/orchestration-vs-automation) - In this article you will learn some of the terms and baseline technologies that will help kick off your interest in Ansible.

* [How to install software with Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/20/9/install-packages-ansible) - covers a few rudimentary concepts and some good Ansible habits, followed up with simple examples on managing software packages on local and remote hosts.

* [3 lessons I've learned writing Ansible playbooks](https://opensource.com/article/20/1/ansible-playbooks-lessons) - Set yourself right with good habits handed on from a real Ansible veteran. Source control, documentation, testing, simplification, and optimization are the keys to automation success.

* [My first day using Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/20/10/first-day-ansible) - Outlines the thought process the author took to solve a repetitive development task. It starts with a baseline of what Ansible needs and illustrates some simple plays and tasks.

Once you have the basics and learned some good habits, it’s time to turn to  more specific topics with concrete examples.

* [Manage your Raspberry Pi fleet with Ansible](https://opensource.com/article/20/9/raspberry-pi-ansible) - walks through an example of deploying and managing fleets of RPi units. It presents concepts of security and maintenance in constrained environments.

* [Integrate your calendar with Ansible to avoid schedule conflicts](https://opensource.com/article/20/10/calendar-ansible) – This short article  introduces how to use pre-task and conditionals to enforce execution blackout windows in your automation schedule.

* [Create an Ansible module for integrating your Google Calendar](https://opensource.com/article/20/10/ansible-module-go) - The author completes the calendar blackout concept by diving into the writing of a custom Ansible module in Go to achieve the desired calendar connection. The focus here is introducing different ways you can structure and invoke Go programs and how to pass the required data tp Ansible and receive the desired output.

Kubernetes is a hot topic these days and the following submission present some great examples to learn new skills:

* [Automate your container orchestration with Ansible modules for Kubernetes](https://opensource.com/article/20/9/ansible-modules-kubernetes) – Introduces the Ansible Kubernetes module, walks through a basic minikube installation for testing, and presents some basic examples of the “k8s”  module for pod control.

* [Build a Kubernetes Minecraft server with Ansible's Helm modules](https://opensource.com/article/20/10/kubernetes-minecraft-ansible) - Explains the
concept of Helm Chart applications, Ansible collections, and executing a fun project to set up your own Minecraft server in a k8s cluster.
